# FCC Budget App

A simple program designed to keep track of different budgets. It can create different budget categories, each with its own name, total funds, and ledger.

The user can deposit funds into a category, as well as withdraw funds from it and transfer funds between categories. They also have the option to display the percentage withdrawals from each of their budget categories.
